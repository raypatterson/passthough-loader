# Passthrough Loader

## Purpose

To allow the creation of ad hoc [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) [loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html).

> Inspired by [gulp-tap](https://github.com/geejs/gulp-tap).

## Usage

### Install

```shell
npm install --save-dev passthough-loader
```

### Implement

```javascript
const webpackConfig = {
	entry: [
		'file?./index.html!passthough!./index.tmpl'
	],
	passthough: {
		callback: function renderTemplate(source) {

			return renderMyTemplate(source);

		}
	}
}
```

## Reasons

My specific use case was trying to use an HTML template library and then send
the output though a few more loaders. I wasn't able to achieve this using the
[HTMLWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)
because of inherent limitations to webpack plugins without
[polluting the template files with webpack syntax, or using a webpack specific workaround](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin/issues/325).

There are currently many webpack loaders that are more similar than different,
and yet, may not have configurations to support each individual use case, or
interface completely with the libraries they are implementing. If a loader
does not meet ad hoc requirements, the passthough loader allows the
creation of a loader that will.
